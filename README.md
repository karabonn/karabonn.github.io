# dj class week 5 day 2: individual assignment
## lehigh undergraduate acceptance rates 
![individassignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karabonn/karabonn.github.io/main/LEHIGH%20UNIVERSITY%20UNDERGRADUATE%20ACCEPTANCE%20RATES%20FALL%202017-%20FALL%202021.png)

background information: lehigh university has struggled with its acceptance rate and slipping ranking for years. in today's project, i was interested in learning more about the breakdown of the acceptance rates within each year. 
methods: lehigh univeristy data 
key findings: acceptance rates for undergraduates at lehigh have been increasing from 2016 up until 2020. In 2021, the acceptance rate falls slighty, down to 46%. 
implications: context of the data in this situation is important to note. lehigh has been expanding their student population with sights on becoming a larger-medium sized college while opening a brand new college in 2020. the launch of the health college plays a large part in the increase in acceptance rates. within the health college itself, the most recent acceptance rate in 2021 was 75% as per the lehigh data source noted above.

in this bar chart, i used chartbuilder to visualize the percentage breakdown of residence locations of fall 2021 lehigh undergraduate students. the source of this data is the fall 2021 lehigh profile. residence halls and off campus living appear to be the most popular, with frat and sorority locations coming up smaller than anticipated, hovering around 5%.

# dj class week 9 day 2 weekend assignemnt: 
in this weekend's individual assignment, i sought out to investiagte lehigh's ever-increasing tuition costs, along with the room and board costs. i have been chatting with my friends recently about the newest, latest-and-greatest tuition spike and this motivated me to look at the last few years of available data. 
i used chartbuilder here

# dj week 11 day 2 weekend project: 
for this weekend's project i was sucked in by my sweet tooth to research the top cities in the world with the best ranked desserts. this information if from purewow.com and is a visualization of the rankings, photos and descriptions from this article. the source article is linked here: https://www.purewow.com/travel/best-dessert-cities-in-the-world, it was written by Hannah Loewentheil in 2016.

# dj week 12 day 2 in-class and weekend project 
this project is slightly delayed because i came down with a case of covid, but i just got caught up to speed on using tableau. for this in class project (seeen in the pink photo) i used lehigh party data to evaluate self-indentified genderas it relates to party location preferences. please see the photo below as the computer that hosts tableau was unable to hold a connection to the internet, or else this would be linked directly from a public tableau datasheet. in the chart, you can see that females prefer off campus houses for parties whereas males prefer frat houses. looking at this data, i have suspicions that the students polled may only be in greek life and not involved in athletics. 
# in-class project: Self-Identity and Party Location Preference at Lehigh: 
![djclass1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karabonn/karabonn.github.io/main/djclass1.jpeg)

# weekend project: Pregame Likelihood by Gender & Party Location Preference by Age on the same dashboard 
this weekend project had similar technical difficulties, leaving the finished product below as a jpeg instead of a public tableau board. in the first chart (yellow) comparing gender and likelihood to pregame prior to a party, both females and males were more likely to pregame for on-campus parties than off-campus ones. this leads me to believe that the on-campus responses are from underage students. on the second chart, (green), I compared party location preference with grade in school. from this comparison i found that sophomores were the leading age groups for both frats and off campus parties. as the grades progress in age to junior, senior and fifth-year, there are less replies. i believe this may be because as students get closer to the legal age, they have the ability to move to bars for their preferred location. please see the charts below for visuals.
